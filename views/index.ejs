Nothing works faster or more dependably to bring your mind and body back into balance than a good laugh.

It also helps you to release anger and be more forgiving.  <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/laughter-is-the-best-medicine.htm" target="_blank">read full article</a></blockquote> </p>
